1. **Generate Self-Signed Certificates:** 
For local development, you can create your own certificates. Open your terminal and use OpenSSL (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux).
 
```bash
# This command creates a private key (server.key) and a certificate (server.crt)
# They will be valid for 365 days and won't ask for any info (-nodes).
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -text -out server.crt -keyout server.key -subj "/CN=localhost"        
```       

2. **Move and Secure the Files:** Move these files to your PostgreSQL data directory and set the correct permissions so only the postgres user can read them.  
- First, find your data directory: psql -U postgres -c 'SHOW data_directory;'      
- Let's assume the path is `/var/lib/postgresql/data` (this varies greatly).
```bash
# Replace with your actual data directory path
DATA_DIR=/var/lib/postgresql/data

sudo mv server.key server.crt $DATA_DIR
sudo chown postgres:postgres $DATA_DIR/server.key $DATA_DIR/server.crt
sudo chmod 0600 $DATA_DIR/server.key
```        
3. **Configure postgresql.conf:**
- Find this file (e.g., sudo find / -name postgresql.conf).      
- Edit `/var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf` and add/uncomment these lines:
```ini
ssl = on
ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
```
4. **Configure pg_hba.conf:**
- This file controls which clients can connect. You need to change connections from host to hostssl.
- Edit the file (sudo nano /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf) and change a line like this:  
```
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5 
```
to this: 
``` 
hostssl all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5
```
- This tells PostgreSQL to only allow SSL connections from localhost.
     
5. **Restart PostgreSQL:** You must restart the server for the changes to take effect.
 
```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
# Or on macOS with Homebrew:
# brew services restart postgresql
```

## postgre in docker

The official `postgres` Docker image is minimal and doesn't include text editors like `vim` or `nano` to keep the image size small and secure.

You have several good options to edit the configuration file. The best method depends on whether you want a quick one-time change or a permanent, reproducible setup.

First, let's find the exact path of `postgresql.conf` inside your container.

1.  Find your container's name or ID: `docker ps`
2.  Run this command to find the file (replace `your-postgres-container-name`):

    ```bash
    docker exec -ti your-postgres-container-name psql -U postgres -c 'SHOW data_directory;'
    ```
    A typical path is `/var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf`. We will use this path in the examples below.

### Solution 1: The `docker cp` Method (Recommended for a quick fix)

This is the most straightforward approach. You copy the file from the container to your local machine, edit it with your favorite editor (like VS Code, Sublime, vim, etc.), and then copy it back.

**Step 1: Copy the config file from the container to your host machine.**

```bash
# Syntax: docker cp <container>:<path_in_container> <local_path>
docker cp your-postgres-container-name:/var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf ./postgresql.conf
```
Now you have a `postgresql.conf` file in your current directory on your computer.

**Step 2: Edit the file locally.**
Open the `postgresql.conf` file you just copied and add or uncomment the SSL settings:

```ini
ssl = on
ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt' # Make sure your certs are in the data directory
ssl_key_file = 'server.key'  # Make sure your keys are in the data directory
```
*Note: You will also need to copy your `server.crt` and `server.key` files into the container's data directory using the same `docker cp` method.*

**Step 3: Copy the modified file back into the container.**

```bash
# Syntax: docker cp <local_path> <container>:<path_in_container>
docker cp ./postgresql.conf your-postgres-container-name:/var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf
```

**Step 4: Reload the PostgreSQL configuration.**
For the changes to take effect, you must tell PostgreSQL to reload its configuration. A reload is better than a restart because it doesn't drop active connections.

```bash
docker exec your-postgres-container-name pg_ctl reload
```

### Solution 2: The Best Practice - Using Volumes and `docker-compose`

The most robust and reproducible way is to manage your configuration file **outside** the container and mount it as a volume. This way, your configuration persists even if you destroy and recreate the container.

**Step 1: Create a `docker-compose.yml` file.**
Create this file in your project directory.

`docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: my-postgres-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: '123456' # Set password here
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes:
      # Mount a local directory for persistent data
      - ./postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
       
      # Mount your SSL certs
      - ./certs:/etc/ssl/certs/postgres

# Define a top-level volume for data if you prefer that over a bind mount
# volumes:
#  postgres-data:
```

**Step 3: Start the container.**
Navigate to the directory with your `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


**Step 2: Modify config file and Create certs folder.**
 
1.  Modify `/var/lib/postgresql/data/postgres.conf` by settings :
 
```ini
# ... all other postgres settings ...
ssl = on
ssl_cert_file = '/etc/ssl/certs/postgres/server.crt' # Use the path inside the container
ssl_key_file = '/etc/ssl/certs/postgres/server.key'
```
2.  A folder named `certs` and place your `server.crt` and `server.key` inside it.
```bash
# This command creates a private key (server.key) and a certificate (server.crt)
# They will be valid for 365 days and won't ask for any info (-nodes).
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -text -out server.crt -keyout server.key -subj "/CN=localhost"    
```


**Step 3: Restart the container.**
Navigate to the directory with your `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

Now, your PostgreSQL container is running with your custom configuration. If you ever need to change it, you just edit the `my-postgres.conf` file on your host machine and then reload the config in the container (`docker exec my-postgres-db pg_ctl reload`). This is the standard, professional way to manage configurations with Docker.
