- g++: The GNU C++ compiler.

- std=c++17: Specifies the C++ standard to use. In this case, it's C++17.

- Wall: Enables all compiler warning messages. This helps catch potential issues in the code.

- Werror: Treats all warnings as errors, so the compilation will fail if any warnings are encountered.

- g: Includes debugging information in the compiled output. This is useful for debugging with tools like gdb.

- O2: Enables compiler optimizations at level 2. This balances performance and compilation speed.

- Inest-libs/linux/SDL2/include/SDL2: Adds the directory nest-libs/linux/SDL2/include/SDL2 to the list of directories to search for header files. This is typically used for including third-party libraries like SDL2.

- D_THREAD_SAFE: Defines a macro _THREAD_SAFE. This is often used to enable thread-safe features in libraries or code.

- Isrc: Adds the src directory to the list of directories to search for header files.

- Ideps: Adds the deps directory to the list of directories to search for header files.

- MD: Generates a dependency file (objs/src/rasterizer/pipeline.d) that lists all the header files the source file depends on. This is useful for make to determine if recompilation is needed when headers change.

- MT 'x ': Specifies the target name for the dependency file. Here, it seems to be setting the target name to x, but this is unusual and might be a typo or placeholder.

- MF objs/src/rasterizer/pipeline.d: Specifies the name of the dependency file to be generated (objs/src/rasterizer/pipeline.d).

- c: Compiles the source file into an object file without linking.

- o objs/src/rasterizer/pipeline.o: Specifies the output file name for the compiled object file (objs/src/rasterizer/pipeline.o).

- src/rasterizer/pipeline.cpp: The source file to be compiled.
